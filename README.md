# MultipleMan

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/influitive/multiple_man.png)](https://circleci.com/gh/influitive/multiple_man)

MultipleMan synchronizes your ActiveRecord models between Rails
apps, using RabbitMQ to send messages between your applications.
It's heavily inspired by Promiscuous, but differs in a few ways:

- MultipleMan makes a hard assumption that you're using
  ActiveRecord for your models. This simplifies how models
  are sychronized, which offers a few benefits like:
- Transactions are fully supported in MultipleMan. Records
  which aren't committed fully to the database won't be sent
  to your message queue.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'multiple_man'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install multiple_man

## Usage

### Configuration

MultipleMan can be configured (ideally inside an initializer) by
calling MultipleMan.configure like so:

    MultipleMan.configure do |config|
      # A connection string to your local server. Defaults to localhost.
      config.connection = "amqp://example.com"

      # The topic name to push to. If you have multiple
      # multiple man apps, this should be unique per application. Publishers
      # and subscribers should always use the same topic.
      config.topic_name = "multiple_man"

      # The application name (used for subscribers) - defaults to your
      # Rails application name if you're using rails
      config.app_name = "MyApp"

      # Specify what should happen when MultipleMan
      # encounters an exception.
      config.on_error do |exception|
        ErrorLogger.log(exception)
      end

      # Add opts that go directly to the bunny constructor (Advanced)
      config.bunny_opts = {
        tls_ca_certificates: ['/usr/lib/ssl/certs/cacert.pem']
      }

      # Where you want to log errors to. Should be an instance of Logger
      # Defaults to the Rails logger (for Rails) or STDOUT otherwise.
      config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
    end

### A note on errors

It's extremely important to specify the `on_error` setting
in your configuration. ActiveRecord by default swallows
exceptions encountered in an `after_commit` block, meaning
that without handling these errors through the configuration,
they will be silently ignored.

Errors will be captured and wrapped in a MultipleMan::Error. The
cause will be preserved in Exception#cause.

### Publishing models

#### Directly from the model

Include this in your model definition:

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      include MultipleMan::Publisher
      publish fields: [:id, :name, :type]
    end

#### In an initializer / config file

Add this to an initializer (i.e. `multiple_man.rb`):

```
MultipleMan.publish Widget, fields: [:id, :name, :type]
```

You can use the following options when publishing:

- `fields` - An array of all the fields you want to send to the message queue. These
  can be either ActiveRecord attributes or methods on your model.
- `with` - As an alternative to `fields`, you can specify
  an ActiveRecord serializer (or anything that takes your
  record in the constructor and has an `as_json` method) to
  serialize models instead.
- `as` - If you want the name of the model from the
  perspective of MultipleMan to be different than the model
  name in Rails, specify `as` with the name you want to use.
  Useful for STI.
- `identify_by` - Specify an array of fields that MultipleMan
  should use to identify your record on the subscriber end.
  `id` is used by default and is generally fine, unless you're working in a multi-tenant environment where ids may
  be shared between two different models of the same class.
- (DEPRECATED) `identifier` - Either a symbol or a proc used by MultipleMan to identify your model.

### Publishing

By default, MultipleMan will publish all of your models whenever you save a model (in an `after_commit` hook). If you need to manually publish models, you can do so with the `multiple_man_publish` method, which acts like a scope on your models, like so:

```
# Publish all widgets to MultipleMan
Widget.multiple_man_publish

# Publish a subset of widgets to MultipleMan
Widget.where(published: true).multiple_man_publish

# Publish an individual widget
Widget.first.multiple_man_publish
```

If you're publishing multiple models, it's best to use the
version of multiple_man_publish that operates on a collection. By calling the individual version, a channel is opened and closed for each model, which can impact the thoroughput of MultipleMan.

### Subscribing to models

You can subscribe to a model as follows (in a seperate consumer app):

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      include MultipleMan::Subscriber
      subscribe fields: [:id, :name]
    end

You can pass the following options to the `subscribe` call:

- `fields` - Specify which fields you want to receive from
  the publisher. If this is blank, then any field that is published where your subscriber model has a corresponding `field=` method will be subscribed to.

By default, MultipleMan will attempt to identify which model on the subscriber matches a model sent by the publisher by id. However, if your publisher specifies an `identify_by` array, MultipleMan will locate your record by finding a record where all of those fields match.

### DEPRECATED: multiple_man_identifier

If your publisher specifies an `identifier` option, you *must* include a column on the subscriber side called `multiple_man_identifier`. MultipleMan will attempt to locate models on the subscriber side by this column.

## Listening for model changes

If you want to do something other than populate a model on MultipleMan messages,
you can listen for messages and process them however you'd like:

```
def ListenerClass
  include MultipleMan::Listener
  listen_to 'ModelName'

  def create(payload)
    # do something when a model is created
  end
end
```

## Listening for subscriptions

Once you've set up your subscribers, you'll need to run a background worker to manage
the subscription process. Just run the following:

    rake multiple_man:worker

## Seeding

One common problem when using MultipleMan on an existing project is that there's already a lot of data that you want to process using your listeners. MultipleMan provides a mechanism called "seeding" to accomplish this.

1. On the subscriber side, start listening for seed requests with the following rake task:

```
rake multiple_man:seed
```

2. On the publisher side, indicate that your models should be seeded with the following command:

```
MyModel.multiple_man_publish(:seed)
```

3. Stop the seeder rake task when all of your messages have been processed. You can check your RabbitMQ server

## Upgrading to 1.0

The major change is that MultipleMan will no longer create a queue per listener.
There is only 1 queue that will have multiple bindings to the exchange so that
you have a chance to maintain causal consistency.

Assuming you are using vanilla MultipleMan you will need to run both the
regular worker and the new 'transition_worker' for a short period. The
transitional worker will connect to your old queues, unbind them and allow them
to drain. Once the queues are empty you can safely shut the transitional worker
down and delete the old queues.

So for example if you use a Procfile:

```
multiple_man_worker: rake multiple_man:worker
# Temporary until old queues are drained
transition_worker: rake multiple_man:transition_worker
```
